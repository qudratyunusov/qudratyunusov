List of features that RPCS3 will support in the future and their corresponding status. It's not required for developers to write down here the tasks they are working on. It's just recommended, and if you do so, remember to delete those entries once you finish them, or move them to another category if you couldn't do it. The current categories are:
* **Short term goals:** Tasks that developers are currently doing.
* **Medium term goals:** Stuff that developers could do.
* **Long term goals:** Tasks that are not a priority right now.

Thank you for supporting RPCS3!
