## Welcome to RPCS3, the world's first open-source PlayStation 3 emulator.

### Before starting your support request:
* **Read the [Quickstart Guide](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart).** Watching a YouTube video tutorial or reading a guide elsewhere doesn't count, as the majority of those provides incorrect instructions and quickly get outdated.
* **Make sure you're using the latest RPCS3 build.** We don't provide support for older builds. Make sure you're using the latest build available, as we always pour new improvements into them.
* **Check if your drivers are up-to-date.** Many issues are simply solved by updating your drivers, mainly GPU. Always make sure your GPU drivers are up-to-date before proceeding.
* **Check if your System matches RPCS3's requirements.** Assuming your system runs it because it runs other emulators is not enough. Many people simply ignore this step thinking their system matches the requirements and end up wasting their time trying to get it to work. System Requirements are at the beginning of the Quickstart guide.
* **Pack up your log files.** Copy pasta from the emulator's log window onto a new text file doesn't count, as that's merely a resume from what's happening. Use a compressing tool such as [**7-Zip**](http://www.7-zip.org/) to compress the **RPCS3.log** and **TTY.log** files to a .7z file after closing the emulator.

### Submitting your support request:
* Choose a place to ask for support:
* * **Discord:** Go to the [**#help channel on our Discord Server**](https://discord.me/RPCS3) and submit a message describing your issue alongside your compressed log file.
* * **Forums:** Go to the [**Support section of our forums**](https://forums.rpcs3.net/forum-18.html) and start a new thread or post in an existing one if it discusses the same problem you're experiencing, attaching or linking your compressed log file.
* * **Reddit:** Go to [**/r/rpcs3**](https://reddit.com/r/rpcs3/) and submit a post in the currently pinned **Questions Thread** describing your issue including a link to your compressed log file. 
* **Don't forget to include the compressed file containing the logs.** If it surpasses the file size limit or you cannot upload directly onto the place you're trying to ask for support, upload the log on file sharing websites such as [**MEGA**](https://mega.co.nz/) and link it on your request.
* Include screenshots if you believe they help clarifying your problem. Upload them as attachments to the post or upload them to image sharing websites like [**Imgur**](http://imgur.com/) and link them on your request.
* Provide basic system information. CPU, GPU, OS, RAM and GPU Drivers' version are usually enough.
