## Welcome to RPCS3, the world's first open-source PlayStation 3 emulator.

### Before starting your support request:
* **Read the [Quickstart Guide](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart).** Watching a YouTube video tutorial or reading a guide elsewhere doesn't count, as the majority of those provides incorrect instructions and get quickly outdated.
* **Make sure you're using the latest RPCS3 build.** We don't provide support for older builds. Make sure you're using the latest build available, as we always pour new improvements into them.
* **Check if your drivers are up-to-date.** Many issues are simply solved by updating your drivers. Always make sure your drivers are up-to-date before proceeding.
* **Check if your System matches RPCS3's requirements.** Assuming your system runs it because it runs other emulators is not enough. Many people simply ignore this step thinking their system does not match the requirements and end up wasting their time trying to get it to work. System Requirements are at the beginning of the Quickstart guide.
* **Test with Interpreters too.** PPU/SPU Recompilers are the option that provides the fastest emulation experience while staying accurate. However, some games currently won't work when using the Recompilers. If your game doesn't work using them, test with the Interpreters.
* **Test with all Renders.** As of now, some games will work on some renders but not the others. This will of course change with further development, but make sure you're not using the wrong render for a game. See user input on the forum thread for the game you're trying to run (visit compatibility list, find your game and click on its ID or Title to be redirected), as it will help you find the ones people reported working.
* **Pack up your log files.** Copy pasta from the emulator's log window onto a new text file doesn't count, as that's merely a resume from what's happening. Use a compressing tool such as [**7-Zip**](http://www.7-zip.org/) to compress the **RPCS3.log** and **TTY.log** files to a .7z or .zip file after closing the emulator.

### Submitting your support request:
* Go to the [**Support section of our forums**](https://forums.rpcs3.net/forum-18.html) and start a new thread or post in an existing one if it discusses the same problem. 
* Attach the compressed file containing the logs. If it surpasses the file size limit, upload the log on file sharing websites such as [**MEGA**](https://mega.co.nz/) or [**MediaFire**](https://www.mediafire.com/) and link it on your request.
* Include screenshots if you believe they help clarifying your problem. Upload them as attachments to the post or upload them to image sharing websites like [**Imgur**](http://imgur.com/) and link them on your request.
* Provide basic system information. CPU, GPU, OS, RAM and Video Drivers' version are usually enough.
