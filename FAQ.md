**What do I need to run it?**
> The requirements for running RPCS3 are still not fully known and may change a lot in its current development stage. The absolute minimum requirements for running the program are a modern CPU that supports SSE and a OpenGL 3.3 compatible graphics card.

**Why doesn't RPCS3 support commercial games? Will it support them in the future?**
> RPCS3 cannot run commercial games yet because it's on an early stage of development. A lot of features required to run commercial games still have not been implemented. Commercial games will be supported when the hardware emulation is accurate enough to run them.
