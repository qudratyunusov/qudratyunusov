## Game Compatibility
We have a [game compatibility list on our website](https://rpcs3.net/compatibility).

<br>

### How to update the Compatibility List?
_We track compatibility per Game ID, and not per Game Title. This means that, for example, a disc version and a digital version of the same game have to be reported on different threads and have separated entries on the list._

**If the Game ID is already listed**: Click the Game ID on the compatibility list and you'll be redirected to the forum thread for it, where you can submit a new post. 

**If the Game ID is not yet listed**: Go to our [Commercial Games Section](https://forums.rpcs3.net/forum-4.html) and open a new thread on the appropriate category, depending on your game's compatibility.

**When submitting your report, you must follow the [Guidelines for Submitting Game Reports](https://forums.rpcs3.net/thread-196671.html).**

The game will be added to the Compatibility List after your submission is reviewed.
